### 5+ features I have included from the project requirements list.
	1. 	Read in data from a local csv file using Pandas read_ functions.
	2.1 Use built-in pandas functions to remove 0’s, where they don’t belong in your dataset, replacing one value to another 
			e.g. replacing expenses to medical expenses in the column category.
	2.2 Formatting the date.
	3.	Calculations with Pandas, like finding the sum(), mean(), count(), max(), min() of a column. 
			I calculated average and rounded the result to display 2 decimal points.
	4.	Made 3 basic plots with matplotlib to visualize my data.
	5.	Added Markdowns on JupyterNotebook and description of the graphs from matplotlib.
